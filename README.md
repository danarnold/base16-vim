# Base16 Vim

This is a fork of `base16-vim` that has the latest themes, as built by
[base16-builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder).
There appear to be some bugs with some colorschemes, so use at your own risk.

Check out Chris Kempson's [original
repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for installation
instructions, etc.
